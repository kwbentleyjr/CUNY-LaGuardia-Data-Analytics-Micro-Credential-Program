# Unit 4: Machine Learning and Modeling Techniques
The files in this folder represent my knowledge of using Python machine learning algorithms and modeling techniques.

Topics covered in this unit included:

• Linear regression
• Logistic regression
• KNN
• Decision Trees
• Random Forests
• Scikit-Learn

The example code in this folder demonstrates I have achieved the following course outcomes:

• A solid foundation of machine learning techniques, and how to use them in Python.
• Understand and use the modeling process and why it’s important for all machine learning.
• How to leverage Python’s advanced libraries to perform Machine Learning.
